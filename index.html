                <p>
                    Half a league, half a league,<br>
                    Half a league onward,<br>
                    All in the valley of Death<br>
                    Rode the six hundred.<br>
                    "Forward, the Light Brigade!<br>
                    Charge for the guns!" he said.<br>
                    Into the valley of Death<br>
                    Rode the six hundred.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Forward, the Light Brigade!"<br>
                    Was there a man dismayed?<br>
                    Not though the soldier knew<br>
                    Someone had blundered.<br>
                    Theirs not to make reply,<br>
                    Theirs not to reason why,<br>
                    Theirs but to do and die.<br>
                    Into the valley of Death<br>
                    Rode the six hundred.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cannon to right of them,<br>
                    Cannon to left of them,<br>
                    Cannon in front of them<br>
                    Volleyed and thundered;<br>
                    Stormed at with shot and shell,<br>
                    Boldly they rode and well,<br>
                    Into the jaws of Death,<br>
                    Into the mouth of hell<br>
                    Rode the six hundred.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flashed all their sabres bare,<br>
                    Flashed as they turned in air<br>
                    Sabring the gunners there,<br>
                    Charging an army, while<br>
                    All the world wondered.<br>
                    Plunged in the battery-smoke<br>
                    Right through the line they broke;<br>
                    Cossack and Russian<br>
                    Reeled from the sabre stroke<br>
                    Shattered and sundered.<br>
                    Then they rode back, but not<br>
                    Not the six hundred.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cannon to right of them,<br>
                    Cannon to left of them,<br>
                    Cannon behind them<br>
                    Volleyed and thundered;<br>
                    Stormed at with shot and shell,<br>
                    While horse and hero fell,<br>
                    They that had fought so well<br>
                    Came through the jaws of Death,<br>
                    Back from the mouth of hell,<br>
                    All that was left of them,<br>
                    Left of six hundred.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When can their glory fade?<br>
                    O the wild charge they made!<br>
                    All the world wondered.<br>
                    Honour the charge they made!<br>
                    Honour the Light Brigade,<br>
                    Noble six hundred!<br>
